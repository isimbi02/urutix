# Frontend Vite Cache Issue - Fixed

## Problem

Frontend failed to start with error:
```
Failed to resolve import "./pages/admin/MonitoringDashboard" from "src/App.tsx"
```

## Root Cause

Vite's cache was stale and didn't recognize the existing `MonitoringDashboard.tsx` file at `frontend/src/pages/admin/MonitoringDashboard.tsx`.

## Solution

Cleared Vite's cache by removing:
- `node_modules/.vite/` directory
- `dist/` directory

## Files Verified

✅ `frontend/src/pages/admin/MonitoringDashboard.tsx` - File exists
✅ `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Import is correct

## How to Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend should now start without errors.

## If Issue Persists

If you still see import errors, try:

```bash
# Full clean
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
rm -rf dist
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Prevention

Vite cache issues can occur after:
- Git branch switches
- File moves/renames
- Merge conflicts
- Node modules updates

Always clear cache after these operations:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.vite dist
```

Or use the provided script:
```bash
./fix-vite-cache.ps1
```

## Status

✅ Cache cleared
✅ Ready to start frontend
✅ MonitoringDashboard file verified
